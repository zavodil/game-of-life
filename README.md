The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine. 

[RULES & Details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Rules).

## Description

This contract implements simple counter backed by storage on blockchain.
Contract in `contract/src/lib.rs` provides methods to increment / decrement counter and get it's current value or reset.

Plus and minus buttons increase and decrease value correspondingly. When button L is toggled, a little light turns on, just for fun. RS button is for reset. LE and RE buttons to let the robot wink at you.

## To Run
Open in the Gitpod link above or clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/near-examples/game-of-life
```


## Setup [Or skip to Login if in Gitpod](#login)
Install dependencies:

```
yarn
```

If you don't have `Rust` installed, complete the following 3 steps:

1) Install Rustup by running:

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

([Taken from official installation guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install))

2) Configure your current shell by running:

```
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

3) Add wasm target to your toolchain by running:

```
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Next, make sure you have `near-cli` by running:

```
near --version
```

If you need to install `near-cli`:

```
npm install near-cli -g
```

Start the example!

```
./build.sh
near dev-deploy -f
```

## To Test

```
cd contract
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

## To Explore

- `src/lib.rs` for the contract code

## To Build the Documentation

```
cd contract
cargo doc --no-deps --open
```
